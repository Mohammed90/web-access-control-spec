##### v0.1.1

- Change the [Referring to Resources](#referring-to-resources) section --
  the recommended solution is simply to use `acl:Control`, and not refer
  to the ACL resource itself in its own contents.
- Remove the phrasing that WAC does not privilege the ACL resources.
- Clarify that `acl:Control` gives access even to *read* the ACL resource.
  Without that permission, a user cannot read the resource.

##### v0.1.0

First draft of spec, as of Apr 2016.
